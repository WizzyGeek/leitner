"Softening Process of Zeolite": """

"Regeneration process of Zeolite": """
CaZe (or) MgZe + 2 NaCl --> Na2Ze + CaCl2 or MgCl2

"Advantages of Zeolite process": """
o Residual hardness of water is about 10 ppm only
o Equipment is small and easy to handle
o Time required for softening of water is small
o No sludge formation and the process is clean
o Zeolite can be regenerated easily using brine solution
o Any type of hardness can be removed without any modifications to the process
""",
"Disadvantages of Zeolite": """
1. Coloured water or water containing suspended impurities
cannot be used without filtration
---
2. Water containing acidic pH cannot be used for softening since
acid will destroy zeolite.

"Which resin comes first in water softening by IER and Why?": """
Hard water should be first passed through the cation exchanger and then
Anion exchanger to avoid hydroxides of Ca2+ and Mg2+ getting formed
""",
"Is water directly from a mixed bed deioniser suitable for human consumption?": "No, the water from a mixed bed deioniser comes in contact with resins multiple times resulting in a TDS of 1ppm which is unfit for consumption",
"[IER] Advantages": """
1. Can be used for highly acidic and highly alkaline water
2. Residual Hardness is as low as 2ppm
3. Very good for treating water for high pressure boilers
""",
"[IER] Disadvantages": """
1. Expensive equipment and chemicals
2. Turbidity of water should be < 10 ppm. Otherwise output will
reduce; turbidity needs to be coagulated before treatment.
3. Needs skilled labour
